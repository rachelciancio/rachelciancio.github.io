			  <h1>Lyrics</h1>
			  <p><br>
			  	Asked a girl what she wanted to be<br>
					She said baby, "Can't you see<br>
					I wanna be famous, a star on the screen<br>
					But you can do something in between"<br>
					<br>
					Baby you can drive my car<br>
					Yes I'm gonna be a star<br>
					Baby you can drive my car<br>
					And maybe I love you<br>
					<br>
					I told a girl that my prospects were good<br>
					And she said baby, "It's understood<br>
					Working for peanuts is all very fine<br>
					But I can show you a better time"<br>
					<br>
					I told that girl I can start right away<br>
					And she said, "Listen baby I got something to say<br>
					I got no car and it's breaking my heart<br>
					But I've found a driver and that's a start"<br>
					<br>
					Baby you can drive my car<br>
					Yes I'm gonna be a star<br>
					Baby you can drive my car<br>
					And maybe I love you<br>
					Beep beep'm beep beep yeah<br>
					Beep beep'm beep beep yeah<br>
					Beep beep'm beep beep yeah<br>
					Beep beep'm beep beep yeah (fade out)<br>
